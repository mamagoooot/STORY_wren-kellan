## üß¨ Core Concept
A slow-burn, enemies-to-lovers dark romance/thriller set in Israel, blending espionage, protekziya culture, deep emotional trauma, humor, and found family. The story follows Wren‚Äîa quirky, chaos-prone photojournalist with buried scars‚Äîand Kellan, a cold, emotionally fractured sniper with ties to secret intelligence. Their paths collide in the aftermath of a botched mission, forcing them into hiding, survival, and ultimately, entanglement.

## Interpretive Notes

Wren‚Äôs aesthetic isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdesigned.‚Äù It‚Äôs accumulated. Every item in her space tells a story‚Äîoften literally labeled, folded, or pinned. Her wardrobe looks like it could be hiding secrets in the lining. Her living space smells like coffee, dust, and lavender, and looks like a storm passed through‚Äîbut on purpose.

She's not a trend. She's a *tale*.

---

## Use in Storytelling

This visual reference informs:
- Set design for her apartment or work studio.
- How she physically contrasts with Kellan‚Äôs precise, military-adjacent look.
- Costume and disguise choices in their on-the-run scenes.
- The emotional texture of quiet moments (her scrolling through old photos, wrapping herself in her favorite scarf, sketching outfits in the margins of a spy file...).


### Kellan
- **Age**: 30s‚Äì40s  
- **Profession**: Assassin / Shadow operative (Ghost Division)  
- **Personality**: Controlled, repressed, tactical genius with sudden emotional sharpness when pushed, Blends in, prefers silence, lethal but not cruel
- **Backstory Highlights**:
  - Normal childhood with sisters; obsessed with spy culture.
  - Recruited young and slowly shaped into a killer‚Äîwithout realizing until it was too late.
  - No tattoos (unlike Mafia), but carries layered scars, internalized rules, and buried guilt.
  - Has a hidden academic past‚Äîstudied sociology or philosophy, which sometimes resurfaces.
- **Dynamic with Wren**:
  - Starts as a mission. Becomes confusion. Then obsession. Then protection. Then... he‚Äôs the one who cracks.
