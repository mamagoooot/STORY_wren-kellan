## 🧬 Core Concept
A slow-burn, enemies-to-lovers dark romance/thriller set in Israel, blending espionage, protekziya culture, deep emotional trauma, humor, and found family. The story follows Wren—a quirky, chaos-prone photojournalist with buried scars—and Kellan, a cold, emotionally fractured sniper with ties to secret intelligence. Their paths collide in the aftermath of a botched mission, forcing them into hiding, survival, and ultimately, entanglement.

## 🎬 SCENES & SNIPPETS

- **Ren Faire Scene**: Kellan tries not to get pulled into a bow and arrow contest. Wren teases him. He blends in *too* well.
- **Wren’s Apartment**: She insists on retrieving her laptop and Mr. Pancake. Nosy neighbor misinterprets them as lovers. Kellan is mildly horrified.
- **Surveillance Scene**: Kellan sitting in a tech-bro disguise at a café, watching Wren. A cat stares at him from a windowsill.
- Ari *insists* on giving Kellan a makeover — not realizing he's a dangerous operative at first.
- Possible scene: Ari's studio filled with chaotic fabric, music blasting, Wren half-hiding while Kellan broods in the corner.
- Kellan gets pulled into a situation where he has to wear something ridiculous or fashionable and hates every second of it.
- Ari flirts just enough to make Kellan uncomfortable — not seriously, just for the reaction.

## 🔒 Emotional DNA

- WREN
  - Wren is haunted by proximity to trauma.
  - She doesn’t cry wolf—she locks the doors.
  - She doesn’t scream—she takes photos.
  - She doesn’t trust safety—because she’s learned how fast it burns.
  - All of it lives just beneath her jokes, just behind her camera lens.
  - And **Kellan?** He sees it. And for once, he doesn’t look away.

## 🪄 WORLDBUILDING & STYLE

- Thriller-romance tone
- Emotionally grounded, not high-tech spy fantasy
- Dark humor, misinterpreted romance scenes, slow tension
- Visual cues: scars, tired shadows, contrast between her colorful chaos and his dark control
- Ari adds color, humor, and a sense of grounded normalcy from Wren’s “before” world. His presence contrasts Kellan’s tight-lipped control.
- Symbolic: Ari helps Wren *choose her disguise*, while Kellan tries to strip it away.
