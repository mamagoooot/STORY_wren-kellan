## Interpretive Notes

Wren‚Äôs aesthetic isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdesigned.‚Äù It‚Äôs accumulated. Every item in her space tells a story‚Äîoften literally labeled, folded, or pinned. Her wardrobe looks like it could be hiding secrets in the lining. Her living space smells like coffee, dust, and lavender, and looks like a storm passed through‚Äîbut on purpose.

She's not a trend. She's a *tale*.

---

## Use in Storytelling

This visual reference informs:
- Set design for her apartment or work studio.
- How she physically contrasts with Kellan‚Äôs precise, military-adjacent look.
- Costume and disguise choices in their on-the-run scenes.
- The emotional texture of quiet moments (her scrolling through old photos, wrapping herself in her favorite scarf, sketching outfits in the margins of a spy file...).

### Kellan
- **Age**: 30s‚Äì40s  
- **Profession**: Assassin / Shadow operative (Ghost Division)  
- **Personality**: Controlled, repressed, tactical genius with sudden emotional sharpness when pushed, Blends in, prefers silence, lethal but not cruel
- **Backstory Highlights**:
  - Normal childhood with sisters; obsessed with spy culture.
  - Recruited young and slowly shaped into a killer‚Äîwithout realizing until it was too late.
  - No tattoos (unlike Mafia), but carries layered scars, internalized rules, and buried guilt.
  - Has a hidden academic past‚Äîstudied sociology or philosophy, which sometimes resurfaces.
- **Dynamic with Wren**:
  - Starts as a mission. Becomes confusion. Then obsession. Then protection. Then... he‚Äôs the one who cracks.

---

## ‚è≥ PLOT & TIMELINE

### ACT I
***Overview***
- Wren witnesses something at a festival
- Kellan is sent to clean it up (kill her)
- Wren escapes ‚Äî not through skill, but accident
#### CHAPTER 1 ‚Äì "Wrong Lens"
#### CHAPTER 2 ‚Äì "The Tent Job Goes Sideways"
Kellan, a ghost-level operative, infiltrates Wren‚Äôs yurt to recover the evidence and eliminate her cleanly. No witnesses. No drama. Just wipe the drive, destroy the backups, and silence the loose end.

He‚Äôs mid-mission when a glitter-covered troll cosplayer kicks open the tent flap and yells, ‚ÄúBro! Lager?‚Äù
Kellan nearly strangles him on instinct. Wren appears, assuming he‚Äôs just another awkward actor who got lost. She offers him a seat and introduces him to a conga line of goat-hoofed acrobats.

Every time Kellan tries to slip away to finish the job, someone hands him a drink or shoves a tambourine into his hands. He contemplates killing the entire crowd, but there are too many witnesses. Too many distractions. Too much mead.

Eventually, he decides not to turn the place into a medieval bloodbath‚Äîtempting as it is. He staggers out, sleep-deprived, overstimulated, and somehow slightly glittered. The target is still alive. For now.

### ACT II
- Psychological chase begins
- They cross paths multiple times
- Obsession grows ‚Äî Wren is unpredictable
- Emotional cracks form; Kellan delays action
- Betrayal happens (Wren tries to get him arrested or escapes him at cost)
- 
#### CHAPTER 3 ‚Äì "Not the Popcorn Guy"

#### CHAPTER 4 ‚Äì "Brunch Is Not a Threat"
Wren invites him to brunch. Her friends flirt and interrogate. Kellan considers assassination via mimosa. Wren shares her fries. He doesn‚Äôt smile. She‚Äôs intrigued. He‚Äôs still considering murder.

---

#### CHAPTER 5 ‚Äì "Glass and Steel"

---

#### CHAPTER 8 ‚Äì "Delay Protocol"
He lets her run. For fun. Then the agency sends a kill order. He realizes they‚Äôre going to take *his* target. Not acceptable.

---

#### CHAPTER 9 ‚Äì "The Only Safe Place Is in His Hands (And That‚Äôs the Problem)"

## ü™Ñ WORLDBUILDING & STYLE

- Thriller-romance tone
- Emotionally grounded, not high-tech spy fantasy
- Dark humor, misinterpreted romance scenes, slow tension
- Visual cues: scars, tired shadows, contrast between her colorful chaos and his dark control
- Ari adds color, humor, and a sense of grounded normalcy from Wren‚Äôs ‚Äúbefore‚Äù world. His presence contrasts Kellan‚Äôs tight-lipped control.
- Symbolic: Ari helps Wren *choose her disguise*, while Kellan tries to strip it away.
