## 🎬 SCENES & SNIPPETS

- **Ren Faire Scene**: Kellan tries not to get pulled into a bow and arrow contest. Wren teases him. He blends in *too* well.
- **Wren’s Apartment**: She insists on retrieving her laptop and Mr. Pancake. Nosy neighbor misinterprets them as lovers. Kellan is mildly horrified.
- **Surveillance Scene**: Kellan sitting in a tech-bro disguise at a café, watching Wren. A cat stares at him from a windowsill.
- Ari *insists* on giving Kellan a makeover — not realizing he's a dangerous operative at first.
- Possible scene: Ari's studio filled with chaotic fabric, music blasting, Wren half-hiding while Kellan broods in the corner.
- Kellan gets pulled into a situation where he has to wear something ridiculous or fashionable and hates every second of it.
- Ari flirts just enough to make Kellan uncomfortable — not seriously, just for the reaction.

## 🪄 WORLDBUILDING & STYLE

- Thriller-romance tone
- Emotionally grounded, not high-tech spy fantasy
- Dark humor, misinterpreted romance scenes, slow tension
- Visual cues: scars, tired shadows, contrast between her colorful chaos and his dark control
- Ari adds color, humor, and a sense of grounded normalcy from Wren’s “before” world. His presence contrasts Kellan’s tight-lipped control.
- Symbolic: Ari helps Wren *choose her disguise*, while Kellan tries to strip it away.
