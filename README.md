## 🧬 Core Concept
A slow-burn, enemies-to-lovers dark romance/thriller set in Israel, blending espionage, protekziya culture, deep emotional trauma, humor, and found family. The story follows Wren—a quirky, chaos-prone photojournalist with buried scars—and Kellan, a cold, emotionally fractured sniper with ties to secret intelligence. Their paths collide in the aftermath of a botched mission, forcing them into hiding, survival, and ultimately, entanglement.

## Interpretive Notes

Wren’s aesthetic isn’t “designed.” It’s accumulated. Every item in her space tells a story—often literally labeled, folded, or pinned. Her wardrobe looks like it could be hiding secrets in the lining. Her living space smells like coffee, dust, and lavender, and looks like a storm passed through—but on purpose.

She's not a trend. She's a *tale*.

---

## Use in Storytelling

This visual reference informs:
- Set design for her apartment or work studio.
- How she physically contrasts with Kellan’s precise, military-adjacent look.
- Costume and disguise choices in their on-the-run scenes.
- The emotional texture of quiet moments (her scrolling through old photos, wrapping herself in her favorite scarf, sketching outfits in the margins of a spy file...).


### Kellan
- **Age**: 30s–40s  
- **Profession**: Assassin / Shadow operative (Ghost Division)  
- **Personality**: Controlled, repressed, tactical genius with sudden emotional sharpness when pushed, Blends in, prefers silence, lethal but not cruel
- **Backstory Highlights**:
  - Normal childhood with sisters; obsessed with spy culture.
  - Recruited young and slowly shaped into a killer—without realizing until it was too late.
  - No tattoos (unlike Mafia), but carries layered scars, internalized rules, and buried guilt.
  - Has a hidden academic past—studied sociology or philosophy, which sometimes resurfaces.
- **Dynamic with Wren**:
  - Starts as a mission. Becomes confusion. Then obsession. Then protection. Then... he’s the one who cracks.

#### 🗓️ Wren & Kellan Post-Shooting Safehouse Timeline (with Dual Ratings)

This timeline tracks all locations Wren and Kellan stay in after Wren is shot—detailing location, duration, what happens, and how each of them rates the experience (very differently).
---

#### 0. 📍 Initial Incident
- **Event**: Wren is shot.
- **Location**: Unknown urban area.

**Wren’s Rating**: ★★☆☆☆  
> “Zero snacks. Creepy silence. Nice towels. Lost two stars for blood-shaming me.”

**Kellan’s Rating**: ★★★★☆  
> “Clean. Secure. Strategically located. Would’ve been five stars until she reorganized my knives by color.”

---

---

### ACT III
- Kellan breaks mission protocol
- Final confrontation (rescue, fake death, or mutual collapse)
- They go separate ways or vanish together

---

## 🪄 WORLDBUILDING & STYLE

- Thriller-romance tone
- Emotionally grounded, not high-tech spy fantasy
- Dark humor, misinterpreted romance scenes, slow tension
- Visual cues: scars, tired shadows, contrast between her colorful chaos and his dark control
- Ari adds color, humor, and a sense of grounded normalcy from Wren’s “before” world. His presence contrasts Kellan’s tight-lipped control.
- Symbolic: Ari helps Wren *choose her disguise*, while Kellan tries to strip it away.
