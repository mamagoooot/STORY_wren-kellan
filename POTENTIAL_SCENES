### Wren and Kellan prequel vignette from their “lost domestic files.”
Wren, wide awake at 12:23 AM, stuck between a kid named Captain Smashinator and a half-shed-fluff-ball cat named Spotty, muttering,
“Why do I have a tiny screwdriver in my bed?”
Meanwhile, Kellan, from across the room, deadpan:
“It’s his weapon of choice. I trained him.”
Spotty stares into the corner, mid-cry.
Kellan doesn’t blink. “I taught the cat that, too.”
Wren: “...You’re not helping.”
Kellan: “You said you wanted support.”
Wren: “Emotional support. Not tactical reinforcements from a cat with unresolved trauma.”
Kellan, getting up to make tuna: “Same thing.”

### Worst First Date Ever
“This is the worst first date I’ve ever been on.”  
“Is that what this is?”  
“You didn’t deny it.”  
“You should’ve run.”  
“You should’ve killed me.”  
Silence.  
“So why didn’t you?”  
“Because… you remind me I used to feel.”

### Wren's Hot Possibly-Unstable New Acquaintance
Okay. So, he’s got the look.
Tall. Angular. Those eyes that say "I’ve seen some sht"*, even though he hasn’t actually said anything.
But the more she sees him, the more she’s convinced:
He’s not dangerous.
He’s wounded.
There’s a difference.
Like… he probably hasn’t had a proper holiday meal in years.
Thanksgiving? Frozen pizza and silence.
Passover? One matzah, no company, and an existential crisis.
She should invite him somewhere. Or bake him something. Maybe a weird pie. He looks like the type who’s never had lemon meringue. Or friends.
And those clothes? All black. All fitted. All “I’m a shadow on the wall.”
No variety. No warmth.
God, he needs a gay friend.
“I should ask Eli if he’s free Saturday. We could take him to that consignment place. Get him a jacket that’s not tactical.”
Also: his hair?
It’s not bad. But it’s giving "I cut this in the mirror with a survival knife."
Which… could be true?
“Poor guy. He probably watched some ninja movies for therapy. Took one too many stunt workshops. Got stuck in character.”
She wonders if he even knows how to smile.
Like, not the I’m plotting your downfall kind of smile, but a real one.
One with teeth and crinkles. Something that says: "I have pets. I eat ice cream sometimes."
“He needs someone. Someone patient. Someone with a label maker and mild OCD. Someone with soup.”
She sighs.
“I bet he’s never even been to Ikea.”

### Brunch Is Not a Threat
Setting: Local market plaza. Sunday morning. Wren’s juggling her camera, iced coffee, and a box of overpriced granola she didn’t mean to buy. She spots him—again—across the square. Leaning on a bench. Watching.
Wren (to herself):
“Okay, he’s either obsessed with me or tragically under-socialized. Either way, he needs pancakes.”
She approaches. Confident, awkward, holding her coffee like a peace treaty.
“Hey! You again.”
Kellan turns, slow. Neutral expression. Classic death stare.
“You’ve been following me.”
“What? No. I mean... we keep running into each other. It’s kind of adorable, actually.”
She grins. He doesn't blink.
“I’m having brunch with some friends. You should come.”
“No.”
“Okay, that was fast.”
(beat)
“Do you have somewhere else to be? Like, mysterious rooftop brooding? Or… classified yoga?”
Kellan says nothing.
Wren presses on, oblivious.
“Look, you seem like someone who eats alone a lot. Probably like... in silence. Over a sink. With no seasoning.”
“You have no idea what I eat.”
“Exactly! So brunch. Ten minutes from here. They do a shakshuka that’ll change your life. Or at least your sodium levels.”
Kellan studies her. Still. Quiet.
This was not part of the protocol.
But it’s an opportunity. Stay close. Keep tabs. Evaluate risk.
And also… he’s never had shakshuka.
“Fine. But I’m not staying long.”
“Sure. That’s what they all say before they fall in love with baked eggs.”
She beams like she’s just recruited someone for a group art project.
He trails behind her, absolutely rethinking his career.
And under his breath, almost to himself:
“This is the dumbest way I’ve ever delayed an execution.”

Setting: Outdoor café under mismatched umbrellas. Wren’s already seated with two friends—Ari, her very expressive, very gay fashion designer friend, and Liv, her dry, chaos-loving best friend from college. The table is covered in small plates, uneven silverware, and one broken salt shaker someone keeps trying to use anyway.
Wren sees Kellan approaching. She waves.
“There he is! You came!”
Kellan nods once. Black T-shirt, dark jeans, no expression. He looks like a security detail who lost his client and decided to just... sit down anyway.
He eyes the table. Too many people. Too many exits. Sunlight. Laughter. It’s a nightmare.
Ari immediately leans forward, elbow on the table.
“Oooookay. Hello, Dark Knight.”
Kellan says nothing.
“You brought a spy,” Ari whispers to Wren, way too loudly. “Does he do that thing where he stares at you for exactly four seconds and you feel like you forgot your name?”
Wren (grinning):
“Right? I thought maybe he was method acting but now I’m thinking he’s just... emotionally repressed.”
Liv sips her mimosa.
“Or he’s an actual assassin. That’d be hotter.”
Kellan’s fork is hovering over a roasted pepper. He’s seriously rethinking not killing all of them.
Wren nudges a plate toward him.
“Try the shakshuka. Not a threat, I promise.”
“I’m not hungry.”
Ari (hand over heart):
“Okay, first of all, rude. Second, if you’re dating Wren, you have to get used to carbs. She feeds everyone like a retired Italian grandmother.”
Kellan finally speaks. Calm. Direct.
“We’re not dating.”
Everyone at the table pauses.
“...Yet,” Liv says, smirking.
Wren laughs nervously.
“Yeah, no. He’s just... around.”
“Mysteriously,” Ari adds.
“Quietly,” says Liv.
“Armed?” Ari asks, raising an eyebrow.
Wren rolls her eyes.
“He’s not armed.”
Kellan casually adjusts something under his shirt that might definitely be a shoulder holster.
Ari leans forward again.
“If you’re going to keep this one, I want to take him shopping. You look like someone who doesn’t believe in colors.”
“I don’t.”
“Tragic.”
Wren catches Kellan’s eye. For just a second. Something unspoken lingers there.
She doesn’t know yet. Not really.
But something in her gut says: I should be careful.
And something else says: Too late.

## 💥 Action / Tension

### 👁️‍🗨️ Surveillance Café
- Kellan is disguised as a tech bro, watching Wren from a café.
- A cat on a nearby windowsill stares him down like it knows who he is.
- Scene is quiet, charged. Kellan is still. The cat doesn’t blink.

### 🪞 Apartment Confrontation
- Kellan corners Wren at her apartment.
- She tries to fight him off with improvised chaos (lamp, loud music, something sticky).
- He doesn't flinch. She realizes too late he was never sent to kill her — not yet.

### 🐫 The Goat at the Drag Fundraiser
- Wren and Ari once accidentally crashed a Purim drag ball that ended with a goat, a costume mix-up, and Wren’s viral photo that got her on a blacklist.
- Mostly comedic. Ari never speaks of it. Wren always does.

### 🔐 Israel-Specific Security Culture Moments
- Kellan tries to function in Israeli society and gets tangled in bureaucracy, protests, and stroller traffic.
- Wren navigates checkpoints like a local sorceress.
- Could be comedic relief with deeper undertones.

## ❤️ Emotional / Turning Points

### 🧿 Scar Reveal
- Wren notices Kellan’s scar during a close moment. It’s healed, old, not cosmetic.
- She asks — he doesn’t answer. But something shifts.

### 🪑 Silent Comfort
- Wren has an emotional collapse (teeth grit, not tears). Kellan is there.
- He doesn’t offer comfort. Just stays in the room. His silence is the gesture.

## 🔥 Virginia Whisper
- Wren’s memory of working in rural Virginia, where a man with drill equipment casually joked, “No one would hear her scream.”
- Introduces her instinctive fear response and sense of spatial danger.
- Used as emotional echo later in Israel when she recognizes similar energy in someone else.

## 🕯️ Fire, Silence, and Locked Doors
- Based on a real event, never shown directly.
- Influences Wren’s avoidance of emotional chaos and deep mistrust of love-turned-violence.
- Line it inspires: *"Nothing. Because I locked the doors."*

## 📚 Pew Pew and Other Warning Signs  
**Scene Module: Wren – Red Couch Moment**  
*Category: Romance / Spy Drama / Visual Aesthetic Canon*

#### 📝 Summary:
This scene captures Wren in a single, emotionally charged moment: lounging on a red couch in an oversized white shirt (his) and olive-green army fatigues (hers), with moody lighting and a finger gun raised casually in mock threat. It balances intimacy, tension, absurdity, and the haunting quiet before a storm. The moment is iconic, untouchable—and deliberately left unresolved.

#### 🧠 Creative Notes:
**Key Visual Elements:**
- Red couch (safehouse setting)
- White shirt = his Shabbat shirt, soft and slightly stolen
- Olive-green fatigues = Israeli army surplus, worn like second skin
- Light: golden, dramatic, slightly dusty
- Finger gun: raised, deadpan, no smile

**Dialogue:**
> **Wren:** “Pew pew.”  
> **Kellan:** “You’re insane.”  
> **Wren:** “Not legally. Technically. I checked.”

#### 🔥 Mood:
- Suspenseful stillness
- Unspoken desire
- Weaponized sarcasm
- Glimpses of emotional risk through gesture and clothing

#### 🎨 Visual Variations Created:
- Line drawing (minimalist)
- Shadow drawing (high contrast threshold)
- Digital painting: “Romance Novel Cover” (glowing eyes)
- Digital painting: “Chiaroscuro Descent” (moody and cinematic)

#### 📖 Expanded Fiction Elements:

**Back Cover Blurb:**
Wren was just a photojournalist with too much caffeine and not enough backup.  
Kellan was a ghost with a past.  
She saw something she wasn’t meant to.  
He was sent to erase it.  
Instead, she stole his shirt, took his couch, and became his most dangerous mission.

**Classified File Excerpt (WRN-947-HH):**
> Status: Civilian Threat  
> Affiliation: Subject K-13 (probable)  
> Profile: High-functioning chaos vector. Susceptible to emotionally unavailable men with trauma stares.  
> Last seen: wearing Subject’s shirt. Weapon: finger gun. Risk: catastrophic.

#### 💡 Notes from the Author:
> “Sleep is where the chaos grows. Salvador Dali connected with aliens through his moustache—I just use a couch, a camera, and a fake pew pew.”  
> – Chaos Goblin (Agent Alias: You Know Who You Are)

#### 🚨 DO NOT RESOLVE
> The magic is in its preservation. No kiss. No fight.  
> Just the shirt. The stare. The raised fingers.  
> And everything unsaid.

## 🔁 Kellan **Visual Memory**
- Younger Kellan in a training facility or underground classroom.
- A female mentor leans over his shoulder as he solves a code puzzle.
- Her hand touches his back. Her voice: “You always were the quickest, K.”
**Usage:**  
Use sparingly—1–2 second flash in early chapters. No explanation. Creates intrigue.

## 🧪 Experimental / Out-of-Order Ideas

### 📝 Fake Journal Entry
- Kellan has to pose as Wren online. Writes a fake blog post mimicking her tone.
- Accidentally reveals how well he knows her.

### 🌀 Alternate Escape
- What if Wren had run the first time instead of freezing?
- Explore how the story would’ve changed. Flashback? Dream?

## Safehouse 4: Ari's Loft – “The Fashion Refuge”

**Location:** Urban penthouse in a trendy, gentrified district  
**Duration:** 1–2 nights  
**Primary Function:** Temporary sanctuary, disguise transformation, intel exchange

### Description:
Ari’s loft is an explosion of color and personality wrapped in sleek, curated elegance. Bright white walls serve as gallery backdrops to bold, modern art and rainbow-themed accent pieces. A burnt-orange velvet couch anchors the living room, flanked by jewel-toned pillows and a rich Persian rug. Custom bookshelves glow with a perfect gradient of color-coded spines. The air smells like citrus and bergamot.

Closets are open displays of possibility—racks of silk, leather, sequins, and practicality, too. Plants in ceramic pots line the window, sharing space with a rainbow-striped throw blanket and fresh-cut flowers in a cobalt vase.

### Key Events:
- Wren gets a real meal, hot shower, and stylish disguise (whether she wants it or not).
- Ari sasses Kellan unapologetically and clocks his emotional constipation within seconds.
- They receive critical intel about Syndicate movement—and maybe a warning from Ari about someone following Wren.
- Wren feels temporarily human again, laughing for the first time in ages.
- Kellan quietly checks the window locks and notes a drawer that’s unusually well-secured.

### Wren’s Rating: ★★★★★  
> “Finally, a place that doesn’t smell like blood and regret. Would live here forever if we weren’t fugitives.”

### QUOTES:
- “You kidnapped her? Darling. If you wanted her attention, there are easier ways.”
---

**Notes:**
- Ari may be more connected than he lets on. He knew things he shouldn’t.  
- Possible callback location if Wren is ever separated from Kellan.  
- Could serve as neutral ground in a future Syndicate standoff.

Okay, so yeah. He’s weird.
Like... suspiciously quiet.
And he has that “dead-inside-but-maybe-I-write-poetry-at-night” look.
But he also carried her broken tripod off the festival field like it weighed nothing. And when she tripped on that kid’s foam sword in the mud, he caught her with one arm like he was trained by wolves or something.
So... yeah. Maybe he’s a little intense. Maybe he stares a bit too long. Maybe when he said “If I wanted you dead, you’d be cold already,” he was just...
acting. Theater trauma therapy. That’s a thing, right?
“He’s probably been through something.”
“Some kind of deep betrayal. Or secret spy upbringing.”
“Maybe his mom left. Or his dad was a warlord. Or he got kicked out of fencing school.”
And the way he handled that gun? Okay. Yeah. That was definitely a prop. Or a stage weapon. They do that in those super immersive LARPs. He probably watched John Wick and then spent months learning how to take apart a Glock for realism.
Also: he’s hot.
Like, unfairly hot.
Hot in a leaning-against-a-dumpster-looking-like-a-Bourne-spin-off kind of way.
Hot in a he-said-my-name-once-and-now-I-want-it-as-a-ringtone kind of way.
And when he said “You should be careful,” it definitely wasn’t a threat. It was concern. Stoic, emotionally unavailable concern.
That’s the good stuff.
So no—she’s not scared of him. Not really. She’s intrigued. Maybe a little concerned about his mental state. But mostly...
“Honestly, he could be an assassin. But like, the reformed kind.”
She should probably just keep an eye on him.
You know. For his sake.




Scene: She Confides… To Him
They cross paths again—this time, at a local coffee shop. She’s convinced he’s just a quiet, awkward regular. Maybe a reenactor. He ends up seated next to her (because of course). She's rattled from a weird noise outside her place last night and finally blurts:
“Okay, this is going to sound insane, but I think I’m being watched.”
(He raises an eyebrow.)
“And I’m pretty sure it’s that guy from the festival. Lord... Zorro or something?”
(Long pause)
“He had a sword and this... vibe. It was hot. But like, dangerous hot. Not good hot.”
Kellan just nods slowly, fighting every instinct not to strangle her right there.
“Dangerous hot. Got it.”
(sips his coffee)
“You should be careful.”


“If we die here, I just want to say—you’re hot. And very chill for a man with obvious trauma.”
He leans close. Low voice. No smile.
“If I wanted you dead, you’d be cold already.”
She shivers.
Then awkwardly laughs.
“Okay, wow. That’s a... pretty intense compliment.”
