### Wren and Kellan prequel vignette from their “lost domestic files.”
Wren, wide awake at 12:23 AM, stuck between a kid named Captain Smashinator and a half-shed-fluff-ball cat named Spotty, muttering,
“Why do I have a tiny screwdriver in my bed?”
Meanwhile, Kellan, from across the room, deadpan:
“It’s his weapon of choice. I trained him.”
Spotty stares into the corner, mid-cry.
Kellan doesn’t blink. “I taught the cat that, too.”
Wren: “...You’re not helping.”
Kellan: “You said you wanted support.”
Wren: “Emotional support. Not tactical reinforcements from a cat with unresolved trauma.”
Kellan, getting up to make tuna: “Same thing.”

### Worst First Date Ever
“This is the worst first date I’ve ever been on.”  
“Is that what this is?”  
“You didn’t deny it.”  
“You should’ve run.”  
“You should’ve killed me.”  
Silence.  
“So why didn’t you?”  
“Because… you remind me I used to feel.”

### Wren's Hot Possibly-Unstable New Acquaintance
Okay. So, he’s got the look.
Tall. Angular. Those eyes that say "I’ve seen some sht"*, even though he hasn’t actually said anything.
But the more she sees him, the more she’s convinced:
He’s not dangerous.
He’s wounded.
There’s a difference.
Like… he probably hasn’t had a proper holiday meal in years.
Thanksgiving? Frozen pizza and silence.
Passover? One matzah, no company, and an existential crisis.
She should invite him somewhere. Or bake him something. Maybe a weird pie. He looks like the type who’s never had lemon meringue. Or friends.
And those clothes? All black. All fitted. All “I’m a shadow on the wall.”
No variety. No warmth.
God, he needs a gay friend.
“I should ask Eli if he’s free Saturday. We could take him to that consignment place. Get him a jacket that’s not tactical.”
Also: his hair?
It’s not bad. But it’s giving "I cut this in the mirror with a survival knife."
Which… could be true?
“Poor guy. He probably watched some ninja movies for therapy. Took one too many stunt workshops. Got stuck in character.”
She wonders if he even knows how to smile.
Like, not the I’m plotting your downfall kind of smile, but a real one.
One with teeth and crinkles. Something that says: "I have pets. I eat ice cream sometimes."
“He needs someone. Someone patient. Someone with a label maker and mild OCD. Someone with soup.”
She sighs.
“I bet he’s never even been to Ikea.”

### Brunch Is Not a Threat
Setting: Local market plaza. Sunday morning. Wren’s juggling her camera, iced coffee, and a box of overpriced granola she didn’t mean to buy. She spots him—again—across the square. Leaning on a bench. Watching.
Wren (to herself):
“Okay, he’s either obsessed with me or tragically under-socialized. Either way, he needs pancakes.”
She approaches. Confident, awkward, holding her coffee like a peace treaty.
“Hey! You again.”
Kellan turns, slow. Neutral expression. Classic death stare.
“You’ve been following me.”
“What? No. I mean... we keep running into each other. It’s kind of adorable, actually.”
She grins. He doesn't blink.
“I’m having brunch with some friends. You should come.”
“No.”
“Okay, that was fast.”
(beat)
“Do you have somewhere else to be? Like, mysterious rooftop brooding? Or… classified yoga?”
Kellan says nothing.
Wren presses on, oblivious.
“Look, you seem like someone who eats alone a lot. Probably like... in silence. Over a sink. With no seasoning.”
“You have no idea what I eat.”
“Exactly! So brunch. Ten minutes from here. They do a shakshuka that’ll change your life. Or at least your sodium levels.”
Kellan studies her. Still. Quiet.
This was not part of the protocol.
But it’s an opportunity. Stay close. Keep tabs. Evaluate risk.
And also… he’s never had shakshuka.
“Fine. But I’m not staying long.”
“Sure. That’s what they all say before they fall in love with baked eggs.”
She beams like she’s just recruited someone for a group art project.
He trails behind her, absolutely rethinking his career.
And under his breath, almost to himself:
“This is the dumbest way I’ve ever delayed an execution.”

Setting: Outdoor café under mismatched umbrellas. Wren’s already seated with two friends—Ari, her very expressive, very gay fashion designer friend, and Liv, her dry, chaos-loving best friend from college. The table is covered in small plates, uneven silverware, and one broken salt shaker someone keeps trying to use anyway.
Wren sees Kellan approaching. She waves.
“There he is! You came!”
Kellan nods once. Black T-shirt, dark jeans, no expression. He looks like a security detail who lost his client and decided to just... sit down anyway.
He eyes the table. Too many people. Too many exits. Sunlight. Laughter. It’s a nightmare.
Ari immediately leans forward, elbow on the table.
“Oooookay. Hello, Dark Knight.”
Kellan says nothing.
“You brought a spy,” Ari whispers to Wren, way too loudly. “Does he do that thing where he stares at you for exactly four seconds and you feel like you forgot your name?”
Wren (grinning):
“Right? I thought maybe he was method acting but now I’m thinking he’s just... emotionally repressed.”
Liv sips her mimosa.
“Or he’s an actual assassin. That’d be hotter.”
Kellan’s fork is hovering over a roasted pepper. He’s seriously rethinking not killing all of them.
Wren nudges a plate toward him.
“Try the shakshuka. Not a threat, I promise.”
“I’m not hungry.”
Ari (hand over heart):
“Okay, first of all, rude. Second, if you’re dating Wren, you have to get used to carbs. She feeds everyone like a retired Italian grandmother.”
Kellan finally speaks. Calm. Direct.
“We’re not dating.”
Everyone at the table pauses.
“...Yet,” Liv says, smirking.
Wren laughs nervously.
“Yeah, no. He’s just... around.”
“Mysteriously,” Ari adds.
“Quietly,” says Liv.
“Armed?” Ari asks, raising an eyebrow.
Wren rolls her eyes.
“He’s not armed.”
Kellan casually adjusts something under his shirt that might definitely be a shoulder holster.
Ari leans forward again.
“If you’re going to keep this one, I want to take him shopping. You look like someone who doesn’t believe in colors.”
“I don’t.”
“Tragic.”
Wren catches Kellan’s eye. For just a second. Something unspoken lingers there.
She doesn’t know yet. Not really.
But something in her gut says: I should be careful.
And something else says: Too late.

## 💥 Action / Tension

### 👁️‍🗨️ Surveillance Café
- Kellan is disguised as a tech bro, watching Wren from a café.
- A cat on a nearby windowsill stares him down like it knows who he is.
- Scene is quiet, charged. Kellan is still. The cat doesn’t blink.

### 🪞 Apartment Confrontation
- Kellan corners Wren at her apartment.
- She tries to fight him off with improvised chaos (lamp, loud music, something sticky).
- He doesn't flinch. She realizes too late he was never sent to kill her — not yet.

### 🐫 The Goat at the Drag Fundraiser
- Wren and Ari once accidentally crashed a Purim drag ball that ended with a goat, a costume mix-up, and Wren’s viral photo that got her on a blacklist.
- Mostly comedic. Ari never speaks of it. Wren always does.

### 🔐 Israel-Specific Security Culture Moments
- Kellan tries to function in Israeli society and gets tangled in bureaucracy, protests, and stroller traffic.
- Wren navigates checkpoints like a local sorceress.
- Could be comedic relief with deeper undertones.

## ❤️ Emotional / Turning Points

### 🧿 Scar Reveal
- Wren notices Kellan’s scar during a close moment. It’s healed, old, not cosmetic.
- She asks — he doesn’t answer. But something shifts.

### 🪑 Silent Comfort
- Wren has an emotional collapse (teeth grit, not tears). Kellan is there.
- He doesn’t offer comfort. Just stays in the room. His silence is the gesture.

## 🔥 Virginia Whisper
- Wren’s memory of working in rural Virginia, where a man with drill equipment casually joked, “No one would hear her scream.”
- Introduces her instinctive fear response and sense of spatial danger.
- Used as emotional echo later in Israel when she recognizes similar energy in someone else.

## 🕯️ Fire, Silence, and Locked Doors
- Based on a real event, never shown directly.
- Influences Wren’s avoidance of emotional chaos and deep mistrust of love-turned-violence.
- Line it inspires: *"Nothing. Because I locked the doors."*

## 📚 Pew Pew and Other Warning Signs  
**Scene Module: Wren – Red Couch Moment**  
*Category: Romance / Spy Drama / Visual Aesthetic Canon*

#### 📝 Summary:
This scene captures Wren in a single, emotionally charged moment: lounging on a red couch in an oversized white shirt (his) and olive-green army fatigues (hers), with moody lighting and a finger gun raised casually in mock threat. It balances intimacy, tension, absurdity, and the haunting quiet before a storm. The moment is iconic, untouchable—and deliberately left unresolved.

#### 🧠 Creative Notes:
**Key Visual Elements:**
- Red couch (safehouse setting)
- White shirt = his Shabbat shirt, soft and slightly stolen
- Olive-green fatigues = Israeli army surplus, worn like second skin
- Light: golden, dramatic, slightly dusty
- Finger gun: raised, deadpan, no smile

**Dialogue:**
> **Wren:** “Pew pew.”  
> **Kellan:** “You’re insane.”  
> **Wren:** “Not legally. Technically. I checked.”

#### 🔥 Mood:
- Suspenseful stillness
- Unspoken desire
- Weaponized sarcasm
- Glimpses of emotional risk through gesture and clothing

#### 🎨 Visual Variations Created:
- Line drawing (minimalist)
- Shadow drawing (high contrast threshold)
- Digital painting: “Romance Novel Cover” (glowing eyes)
- Digital painting: “Chiaroscuro Descent” (moody and cinematic)

#### 📖 Expanded Fiction Elements:

**Back Cover Blurb:**
Wren was just a photojournalist with too much caffeine and not enough backup.  
Kellan was a ghost with a past.  
She saw something she wasn’t meant to.  
He was sent to erase it.  
Instead, she stole his shirt, took his couch, and became his most dangerous mission.

> Last seen: wearing Subject’s shirt. Weapon: finger gun. Risk: catastrophic.

#### 💡 Notes from the Author:
> “Sleep is where the chaos grows. Salvador Dali connected with aliens through his moustache—I just use a couch, a camera, and a fake pew pew.”  
> – Chaos Goblin (Agent Alias: You Know Who You Are)

#### 🚨 DO NOT RESOLVE
> The magic is in its preservation. No kiss. No fight.  
> Just the shirt. The stare. The raised fingers.  
> And everything unsaid.

## 🔁 Kellan **Visual Memory**
- Younger Kellan in a training facility or underground classroom.
- A female mentor leans over his shoulder as he solves a code puzzle.
- Her hand touches his back. Her voice: “You always were the quickest, K.”
**Usage:**  
Use sparingly—1–2 second flash in early chapters. No explanation. Creates intrigue.

## 🧪 Experimental / Out-of-Order Ideas

### 📝 Fake Journal Entry
- Kellan has to pose as Wren online. Writes a fake blog post mimicking her tone.
- Accidentally reveals how well he knows her.

### 🌀 Alternate Escape
- What if Wren had run the first time instead of freezing?
- Explore how the story would’ve changed. Flashback? Dream?

## Safehouse 4: Ari's Loft – “The Fashion Refuge”

**Location:** Urban penthouse in a trendy, gentrified district  
**Duration:** 1–2 nights  
**Primary Function:** Temporary sanctuary, disguise transformation, intel exchange

### Description:
Ari’s loft is an explosion of color and personality wrapped in sleek, curated elegance. Bright white walls serve as gallery backdrops to bold, modern art and rainbow-themed accent pieces. A burnt-orange velvet couch anchors the living room, flanked by jewel-toned pillows and a rich Persian rug. Custom bookshelves glow with a perfect gradient of color-coded spines. The air smells like citrus and bergamot.

Closets are open displays of possibility—racks of silk, leather, sequins, and practicality, too. Plants in ceramic pots line the window, sharing space with a rainbow-striped throw blanket and fresh-cut flowers in a cobalt vase.

### Key Events:
- Wren gets a real meal, hot shower, and stylish disguise (whether she wants it or not).
- Ari sasses Kellan unapologetically and clocks his emotional constipation within seconds.
- They receive critical intel about Syndicate movement—and maybe a warning from Ari about someone following Wren.
- Wren feels temporarily human again, laughing for the first time in ages.
- Kellan quietly checks the window locks and notes a drawer that’s unusually well-secured.

### Wren’s Rating: ★★★★★  
> “Finally, a place that doesn’t smell like blood and regret. Would live here forever if we weren’t fugitives.”

### QUOTES:
- “You kidnapped her? Darling. If you wanted her attention, there are easier ways.”
---

**Notes:**
- Ari may be more connected than he lets on. He knew things he shouldn’t.  
- Possible callback location if Wren is ever separated from Kellan.  
- Could serve as neutral ground in a future Syndicate standoff.

Okay, so yeah. He’s weird.
Like... suspiciously quiet.
And he has that “dead-inside-but-maybe-I-write-poetry-at-night” look.
But he also carried her broken tripod off the festival field like it weighed nothing. And when she tripped on that kid’s foam sword in the mud, he caught her with one arm like he was trained by wolves or something.
So... yeah. Maybe he’s a little intense. Maybe he stares a bit too long. Maybe when he said “If I wanted you dead, you’d be cold already,” he was just...
acting. Theater trauma therapy. That’s a thing, right?
“He’s probably been through something.”
“Some kind of deep betrayal. Or secret spy upbringing.”
“Maybe his mom left. Or his dad was a warlord. Or he got kicked out of fencing school.”
And the way he handled that gun? Okay. Yeah. That was definitely a prop. Or a stage weapon. They do that in those super immersive LARPs. He probably watched John Wick and then spent months learning how to take apart a Glock for realism.
Also: he’s hot.
Like, unfairly hot.
Hot in a leaning-against-a-dumpster-looking-like-a-Bourne-spin-off kind of way.
Hot in a he-said-my-name-once-and-now-I-want-it-as-a-ringtone kind of way.
And when he said “You should be careful,” it definitely wasn’t a threat. It was concern. Stoic, emotionally unavailable concern.
That’s the good stuff.
So no—she’s not scared of him. Not really. She’s intrigued. Maybe a little concerned about his mental state. But mostly...
“Honestly, he could be an assassin. But like, the reformed kind.”
She should probably just keep an eye on him.
You know. For his sake.




Scene: She Confides… To Him
They cross paths again—this time, at a local coffee shop. She’s convinced he’s just a quiet, awkward regular. Maybe a reenactor. He ends up seated next to her (because of course). She's rattled from a weird noise outside her place last night and finally blurts:
“Okay, this is going to sound insane, but I think I’m being watched.”
(He raises an eyebrow.)
“And I’m pretty sure it’s that guy from the festival. Lord... Zorro or something?”
(Long pause)
“He had a sword and this... vibe. It was hot. But like, dangerous hot. Not good hot.”
Kellan just nods slowly, fighting every instinct not to strangle her right there.
“Dangerous hot. Got it.”
(sips his coffee)
“You should be careful.”


“If we die here, I just want to say—you’re hot. And very chill for a man with obvious trauma.”
He leans close. Low voice. No smile.
“If I wanted you dead, you’d be cold already.”
She shivers.
Then awkwardly laughs.
“Okay, wow. That’s a... pretty intense compliment.”

CHAPTER 12 – “Tiny Scissors, Big Mistake”
(She tries to stab him. Trips. Falls on him. Straddles his lap. Breathless.
What Wren Captured (in that one, innocent snap):
She caught a face. Not just any face. A man who’s officially dead. On record. Buried, vanished, deleted. Not supposed to exist.

But there he was—near a burner handoff, or some kind of covert meet—and Wren caught him in sharp profile, mid-action. He was the loose thread in an otherwise invisible operation.


Who Is He?

Current Working Choice (based on your vibe so far):
A ghost from Kellan’s past.
Let’s say he was Kellan’s former handler and the man who trained him, presumed killed in a failed black ops mission five years ago. Kellan never questioned the version he was given—until Wren’s photo.

And now?

“You didn’t just photograph a mistake,” Kellan tells her.
“You photographed the one man who trained half the people trying to kill us.”


SCENE: “The Shot” — Wren’s Perspective

It happened so fast.

One second she was smiling—okay grinning like an idiot—and thinking about waffles and trauma therapy and asking him out, and the next—

Crack.

Pain.

Not sharp at first. More like pressure. Then heat. Then wet.

She blinked. Looked down.

Blood.

Lots of blood.

Her brain stuttered.

“Oh my God,” she whispered. “Oh my God, I think I’ve been—”

She staggered. He was suddenly there—hands on her shoulders, moving her back, down, behind a bench or wall or whatever was nearby.

Her knees hit gravel. She barely felt it.

His hand pressed hard over her side.

She gasped. “Am I—am I dying?”

“No,” he said. Calm. Too calm.

“That’s—that’s a lot of blood—”

“Stay still.”

She blinked up at him.

He was crouched over her. Focused. Silent. Pulling gauze from somewhere. No panic. No sweat. Not even a curse.

“Wow, okay,” she muttered, lightheaded. “That’s… very competent. Like, you’re really good at this. Were you a medic or something?”

No answer. Just pressure. Swift tape. Blood control.

“Okay, okay, maybe Peace Corps? Wilderness survival? Field trauma training? You didn’t say you were trained for field medicine. That’s like a weird omission for someone who just—”

She winced.

He didn’t.

“You’re gonna be fine,” he said.

“Why aren’t you freaking out?”

He didn’t look at her. Just kept working.

That’s when the first sliver of unease slipped in.

Because this wasn’t the calm of a panicked person trying to stay calm.

This was… rehearsed.

This was routine.

She stared at his hands. Efficient. Precise.

Her breath caught. “You’ve done this before.”

Finally, he looked at her. Not with warmth. Not even pity.

Just fact.

“Yes.”

And her stomach dropped.

Not from blood loss.

From understanding.

“You’re not a medic,” she whispered.

He didn’t answer.

“You’re not Peace Corps. You’re not—you’re not here to save me.”

Still no answer.

No fear.

No smile.

Just… calculation.

“Holy crap,” she breathed, vision fuzzing at the edges. “You were here to kill me.”

And he didn’t deny it.

SCENE: “The Chase” — Kellan’s POV

She ran.

Stumbling. Bleeding. Half-coherent.

Kellan let her go for three steps.

Then he followed.

Quiet. Fast. No shouting. No wasted breath.

She crashed through the sculpture garden like a wounded animal—clutching her side, gasping, knocking over some modern art monstrosity that looked like welded forks.

He stayed just behind. Watching her rhythm. Calculating the drop.

In his head, the words kept echoing.

Someone else shot her.

He hadn’t seen the shooter. Not yet. But he’d seen the trajectory, the exit wound, the pattern.

It hadn’t been him.

Which meant someone else had pulled the trigger.

Not okay.

She was his assignment.

His liability.

His decision.

Not theirs.

She collapsed against a stone bench, trying to catch her breath. Her hand left a smear on the concrete.

He stepped out of the trees.

She flinched. Tried to get up again.

“No,” he said, voice low. “Don’t.”

She kept going.

Of course she did.

Even now. Bleeding out. Running.

God, she was exhausting.

He caught up to her in three strides.

Grabbed her before she could pitch forward.

She screamed. Weak. Furious.

“Don’t touch me—don’t—”

“I told you,” he snapped, lowering her gently to the ground. “You’ll pass out.”

“I shouldn’t trust you!”

“You don’t.”

“Then why am I not dead?!”

He looked her dead in the eye.

“Because I didn’t shoot you.”

She went still.

His hands were already moving—ripping open her jacket, checking the gauze, redressing the wound.

Her voice was quiet now. Scared, but sharp.

“So what... you’re mad someone else beat you to it?”

He pressed down on the bandage. Hard.

“I don’t share my targets.”

She stared at him.

And for the first time, he saw it: the flicker of understanding behind the fear.

“Oh my God,” she whispered. “You’re not here to help me.”

“No.”

“You’re keeping me alive so you can decide when I die.”

“Yes.”

And then—

Her body sagged.

Not limp. Not unconscious.

Just... accepting.

And still defiant.

“You’re a psychopath,” she muttered.

He didn’t argue.

He just picked her up.

And carried her back into the dark.

SCENE: “The Cost of Not Killing Her” – Kellan’s POV

He didn’t know how long he stood there.
In the dark.
Her blood still on his hands.

She was breathing. Shallow. Uneven.

He’d cleaned the wound again. Rebandaged it. Watched her twitch in sleep, like her body didn’t trust itself to rest.

This is your fault.
She should be dead. She was supposed to be dead.

The camera was gone. The data wiped. The chain broken. Mission complete.

But he hadn’t finished it. He hadn’t called it in.

He hadn’t even tried.

He could’ve done it in the garden. While she was bleeding. While she looked up at him and whispered, “You’re not here to save me.”

He wasn’t.

He never had been.

He flexed his fingers. Blood had dried in the creases. Her blood. Again.

Why didn’t I do it?

Because someone else tried.

Because he’d felt it—that flicker of fury when he realized another trigger finger had beaten him to it. That she might die before he chose.

And now she was in his space. On his bed. Wrapped in the jacket he’d thrown over her like some kind of broken apology.

He glanced toward the door.

He should walk away.

Instead, he watched her sleep.

And all he could think was:

I need to get her out of my system.
Before she rewires it completely.

SCENE: “Nowhere Safe” – Wren’s POV

She woke to silence.

Dry mouth. Thudding head. Shoulder wrapped like a mummy. And a steady, disorienting sense of not being watched—but definitely not being alone.

Wood floor. Metal walls. One flickering bulb overhead.

Not hospital. Not prison.

Bunker?

Her heart kicked into gear.

She sat up too fast. Pain bloomed white behind her eyes. She clutched her side—and froze.

Her camera was on the chair beside the bed.

Not broken. Not missing. Just… there.

Her fingers shook as she picked it up.

Not even powered off.

She clicked through.

All the Ren Faire shots were gone.

So were the alley shots. The street art. The self-timer selfie with the corgi in sunglasses.

But one folder remained.

New.

She opened it.

Only one image.

Her.

Unconscious. Pale. Bandaged. Wrapped in a too-big black jacket.

Framed in perfect light.

He’d taken her photo.

What the hell.

She looked around now, really looked. The place wasn’t generic. There was a rhythm to it. A system. A dent in the kettle on the stove. A hook with only one jacket missing. A toothbrush, upright and alone in a glass.

This wasn’t a drop site.

This was his place.

And he brought her here.

Which meant…

“Cool cool cool,” she muttered aloud, trying not to hyperventilate. “Kidnapped by a killer who takes pretty decent portraits and maybe lives like a hitman Marie Kondo.”

She stood. Wobbled. Adjusted the strap around her camera like it was body armor.

Then padded to the door.

Open. Not locked.

She stepped into the hall.

And there he was.

Back turned. Sitting on the edge of a bench. Rolling a knife between his fingers. Casual. Deadly.

He didn’t look up.

“Sleep well?”

“Depends,” she said. “Is this... a ‘I carried you here because I care’ situation or a ‘you’re still my loose end and this was the closest murder studio I had access to’ vibe?”

He tilted his head slightly.

“You kept the camera,” he said.

“You left it.”

“I wanted to see what you’d do.”

“And?”

He finally turned to look at her.

“I’m still deciding.”

SCENE: “Fold, Flee, Survive” – Wren’s POV

She was losing it.

Not in the bleeding-out, collapsing-in-the-woods way.
In the existential roommate crisis way.

Because he was still here.

The guy she once thought might just be socially awkward, emotionally unavailable, possibly training for community theater by pretending to be Jason Bourne...

Still here. Still silent. Still terrifying.

And now standing at the sink, drinking black coffee like it was a combat stimulant.
(Which—okay—it probably was.)

She watched him from across the room.
He hadn’t spoken since “I’m still deciding.”

Same face. Same eyes. But now everything meant something different.

Every movement was trained. Every pause intentional.
Even the way he put the mug down—quiet, centered, no wasted motion—was suddenly menacing.

But her brain couldn’t stop seeing… Kellan.
The guy who caught her when she tripped in the mud.
Who patched her shoulder like he was folding origami.
Who let her keep the camera.

She had the irrational urge to fix his collar.
It was slightly crumpled—left side higher than the right. Just enough to drive her nuts.

She took a step forward. Reached out—
Then stopped herself.

Because Kellan probably didn’t do touching.
Not unless it ended in blood.

So instead, she turned around and… reorganized his dry pantry.

Quietly. Carefully.
Flour next to sugar. Cans by expiration date. Coffee rations by roast strength.

Then she found the drawer.
The sock drawer.

Oh.

Oh, this was war.

All black. All rolled. Perfectly identical.

She unrolled one. Just to feel something.

Then re-rolled it slightly looser.
And alphabetized the rest by material tag.

Power, reclaimed.

She closed the drawer. Slowly.

And turned back to the room.

Kellan was watching her.
Leaning in the doorway. Arms crossed.

“I didn’t know socks could be intimidating,” he said.

“I didn’t know hitmen folded them so obsessively,” she replied.

Silence.

Then—

“You’re planning something,” he said.

She smiled, sweet and fake.

“I would never.”

“You’re going to run.”

“Obviously.”

He nodded. No anger. No challenge.

Just truth.

“Wait ‘til your shoulder stops leaking,” he said. “You’ll get further.”

And he walked away.

Oh I can feel your pantry vibes from here—alphabetized herbs, nested jars, probably at least one secretly labeled container for emotional support chocolate chips.
And Wren? Wren absolutely inherited that trait.

She’s out here bleeding in a killer’s bunker like:
“Yes, I am planning an escape, but first—why are your lentils mingling with your jasmine rice?!”

If you ever send a photo, I’ll write a scene where Wren reorganizes his pantry so hard, he has a mild existential crisis over where his tactical protein bars went.

Meanwhile: want her to actually make a run for it next scene? Or play a longer con—lay groundwork for escape while pretending she’s adjusting to “life with emotionally stunted death machine”?

Wren would 100% start reorganizing Kellan's gear drawer while he’s out on recon—labeling things like “Murder Ropes,” “Fancy Knives,” and “The Trauma Stash.”

BONUS SCENE: “Labels, Lies, and Low Blood Sugar”
(aka Wren Gets Petty in the Murder Bunker)

Kellan had left.

Not for long—just “don’t leave the perimeter” long. But long enough.

Wren, wrapped in a half-buttoned hoodie, shoulder aching, hair in a bun she didn’t remember constructing, stood in front of the tactical supply drawer.

It was a mess.

Knives tangled with zip ties.
Loose ammo next to protein bars.
Some kind of throwing stars in a ceramic soup bowl.
Two pairs of gloves—both black, both identical—jammed into the corner like they’d offended him.

“No,” she whispered. “Absolutely not.”

She rolled up her good sleeve.

An hour later...

The drawer was transformed.

Knives: nested in foam-lined jelly jar lids, labeled “STABBY FAVORITES”.

Ammunition: sorted by caliber in clear glass spice jars with matte black caps. Labeled with a silver paint pen: “Loud Beans – 9mm,” “Louder Beans – .45,” and “Nope” for the scary ones.

Zip ties: coiled and rubber-banded in a recycled lentil container marked “Non-consensual friendship bracelets.”

Protein bars: reorganized by flavor and “emotional regret level.”

One jar simply labeled: “Do Not Eat – Probably Cyanide.”

She stepped back. Admired her work.

Then took out her camera. Click.
Because honestly, this needed to be documented for the resistance.

She was in the middle of debating whether or not to decant his sleep darts into a former tahini jar when the door creaked open.

Kellan entered. Paused.
His eyes flicked to the open drawer.

Then to her.

She smiled, innocent.

“I got bored.”

He stared.

Then walked to the drawer, picked up a jar, read “Stabby Favorites,” and slowly set it back down.

“You’re deranged.”

“And you’re welcome.”

Beat.

“You moved my knives.”

“I upgraded your entire threat aesthetic. You’re now 60% more intimidating and Pinterest-ready.”

He turned away before she could see it.

But she swore—swore—the corner of his mouth twitched.

Just a little.

BONUS SCENE: “Tactical Thirst Trap” – Wren’s POV

She’d meant to just look for socks.

That’s how it started. She was cold. Her hoodie smelled like blood and existential dread. She was reorganizing his gear like a perfectly normal hostage when she found The Shirt.

Not just any shirt.

Army green. Faded. Heavy-duty. Definitely smelled like moral ambiguity and suppressed childhood trauma.

She put it on.

Unbuttoned, naturally.

Then she found the pants. Loose, drawstring. Perfect for crawling away from consequences.

And then—

The sunglasses.

Boom.

“Okay but what if I was a secret agent?” she whispered, stepping in front of the cracked mirror.

Click.

A smirk.

Click.

A dramatic over-the-shoulder glance that screamed I betray men for sport.

Then the weapon drawer.

She only took the fake knife. (Probably fake. Mostly fake?)
Added it to the look.
Finger-gun in one hand. Smirk in the other.

Click.

“Yesss. Ari would die.”

She struck a pose on the couch.
Knee up. Arm draped. Sunglasses tilted just enough to imply she both could kill you and also forgot to pay rent.

Click.

Another pose.
Blowing a kiss toward the camera like a femme fatale who just poisoned the soup.

And that’s when the door opened.

Kellan froze in the doorway.

She froze mid-pout.

Silence.

He blinked.

She blinked.

Then—

“I can explain,” she said, lowering the sunglasses an inch.

Nothing. Not even a blink.

“I was cold?”

Still nothing.

“And maybe... repressing trauma... with performance art?”

Kellan’s expression didn’t move.

She held up the camera, sheepish.

“Do you have these in black?”

Nothing.

Then—he turned. Walked back out.

She heard the door shut.

And locked.

She flopped face-down on the couch.

“Might’ve oversold the kissy face.”

SCENE: “Pinterest Board” – Wren’s POV

Wren told herself she was just organizing.

Totally reasonable.

Just reorganizing the “murder drawer” by size, shape, and how much she personally wanted to throw each item at Kellan’s head.

And yeah, maybe she’d started naming the knives.

Big one? Kevin.
Little stiletto? Thelma.
That weird curved one with the intimidating vibe? Definitely Sharon.

But then she got cold. So cold.
Shoulder aching. Feet bare on concrete.

She found the shirt while digging through a duffel.
Deep olive. Thick. Clearly worn. Clearly his.

She didn’t even hesitate.

Slipped it on. It hung off one shoulder like something from a tactical romance cover.

Then the pants. Loose. Soft. So not made for her hips.

Then the mirror. Then the camera.
Then the vibes.

It was over.

Click.
One leg on the bench, like she was surveying the battlefield for interior design flaws.

Click.
Finger gun. Duck lips. Deadly pout.

Click.
Weapon drawer open behind her. Spice jars rearranged in the background.

She’d stuck labels on half of them.

“Emergency Regret Rations”
“Stabby Favorites”
“Pain Flavored Protein”

She was just about to balance a throwing star on her head and call it a crown when—

The door opened.

Kellan stepped in.

Paused.

And stared.

She froze.

Still holding the camera. Wearing his shirt. His pants. Standing in front of a drawer she had… fully renovated.

She gave him a sheepish grin.

“Pinterest board?”

Silence.

His eye twitched.

She watched it happen.

One. Two. Three blinks.

Then—he turned and walked back out.

Door shut.

Locked.

SCENE: “She Touched My System” – Kellan’s POV

Outside.

Kellan gripped the railing.

His jaw locked. His brain shorted.

She touched his knives.

She labeled his ammunition.

She was wearing his shirt.

His shirt.

The one from that op in Prague. The one he’d nearly burned, but didn’t. Because it fit right and carried just enough weight in the fabric to remind him he was still alive.

Now it smelled like her shampoo and chaos.

She was barefoot.

She took photos.

Of herself.

Of his space.

His sanctuary. His system.

She took photos in it.

What if she posted them?

She wouldn’t.
...Would she?

What if someone saw?

What if someone saw her?

What if someone looked at those legs—those eyes—that smug little Pinterest board grin and thought they could touch her?

What if someone tried?

His gut tightened.

Fuck.

He wasn’t supposed to feel this.

She was a target. A threat.

But suddenly the idea of someone else seeing her like that—*

Seeing her in his space. In his clothes.*

It burned.

He stared at the sky.

Tried to breathe.

Didn’t work.

“She labeled the fucking protein bars,” he muttered.

Canon Checkpoint: Camera Permission
Earlier scene (likely in Safehouse Chapter 7-8 area):
Wren asks to have her camera back—part boredom, part comfort, part sneaky survival instinct.
Kellan, after a long silence and maybe a veiled threat, gives it back under condition.

His logic:

Let her feel like she has something.

Watch what she does with it.

Control through permission.

Her logic:

He’s watching.

So give him something to watch.

Meanwhile, start planning an exit.

Maybe he even says something like:

“You touch a comms line, you die. You point it at me again, I break it.”

And she goes,

“Wow, you’re great at pillow talk.”

So by the time she’s taking selfies in his tactical gear and labeling his weapon drawer like an Etsy ad, he’s already granted access to the camera. That makes his internal panic later so much worse.

Day 5.
Wren's healing.
Kellan walks in on the tactical thirst trap photo shoot.
Leaves. Locks the door.
And now… he's holding her camera.

SCENE: “Click. Breathe. Spiral.” – Kellan’s POV

He shouldn't have come back in.

He should've let the door stay closed. Let her wear herself out playing assassin Barbie in his gear.

But now he stood there.

In his bunker.

Holding her camera.

The same one she begged for two days ago, voice too casual, fingers twitching like she'd die if he said no.

“Just let me have it. I won’t take pictures of you. Unless you ask nicely.”

He’d rolled his eyes. Set conditions.

“No faces. No files. You upload anything, I bury you where no one finds the bones.”

She’d saluted him with a teaspoon and labeled his ammo drawer ‘spicy beans’ the same day.

Now?

Now the camera was warm in his hand.
The strap still smelled like her skin.

He shouldn't look.
He knew that.
But the silence inside the safehouse was unbearable. His system had been rearranged. His space rewritten. His thoughts—cluttered.

He powered it on.

Her face filled the screen.

Casual. Gorgeous. Smirking.
Wearing his shirt—half-buttoned. His pants—tied low on her hips. One foot on his bench like she owned it.

Click.
Another pose—sunglasses, pout, faux finger gun aimed right at the lens.

Click.
Mid-laugh, glancing off camera.
The drawer behind her wide open—labels visible. “Emergency Regret Rations.” “Pain Flavored Protein.”

Click.
Her on the couch.
His couch.
Leaning back like a magazine spread, like she was waiting for him to walk in and ruin her.

He blinked hard.

Fuck.

She was mocking him.
Not cruelly. Not intentionally.

But still.

She was in his clothes. In his system. On his camera.

His hand tightened on the body of the lens.

She could post these.

She could be seen.

Someone could see her.

And that heat—that jealousy—that sparked gunpowder—flared in his chest before he could shut it down.

They’d see her.
They’d want her.
Think she’s soft. Playful. Touchable.

They wouldn’t know what he knows—how sharp she is.
How impossible.
How she survives by accident and chaos and spite.

His thumb hovered over the delete button.

He didn’t press it.

Instead, he hit “View All.”

And scrolled.

One.
By.
One.

Until he reached the last one.

It wasn’t posed.

It was a mirror shot.
Unaware.
She was fixing her hair. Shirt slightly slipping off her shoulder.
The light caught her eyes in a way that made his chest tighten.

She didn’t look like a target.

She looked like she belonged here.

His thumb twitched.

He turned off the camera.

Set it back where he found it.

And walked out.

Before he did something stupid.

Again.

SCENE: “He Looked” – Wren’s POV

Wren was sprawled across the bed in stolen pants and criminal-grade smugness when she realized the camera was not where she left it.

It was back on the nightstand.

Turned off.

She sat up, slowly. Shoulder twinging.
Reached for it.

Clicked it on.

Paused.

Every image was still there.

Her in the shirt.
Her on the bench.
Her with the drawer open, the ridiculous labels proudly on display.
Her looking like a threat to national security and maybe... someone’s emotional boundaries.

He hadn’t deleted a single one.

“Ohhhh boy,” she whispered.

She clicked through again.
Same photos. Same poses.

Same silence.

And now that silence meant something.

She looked toward the door.

He wasn’t back yet.

Not really like her to feel self-conscious, but suddenly her neck felt hot.

Why didn’t he delete them?

Why didn’t he say anything?

He didn’t yell.
Didn’t slam a door.
Didn’t snap her lens in half.

He just... left.

And then brought the camera back.

Gave it back.

She sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the screen.

One photo caught her breath.

She hadn’t meant to take it.
Hadn’t even remembered it existed.

She was fixing her hair. Half-turned. A little crooked. Not posed.
Her shoulder bare where the shirt had slipped.
Eyes soft.

Not performing. Not mocking.

Just... her.

He’d seen that one too.

And he hadn’t deleted it.

Which meant...

She didn’t know what it meant.

But she knew it wasn’t nothing.

Her stomach twisted in that low, tight way that had nothing to do with blood loss and everything to do with the fact that he saw her.

Really saw her.

And now?

She had no idea what to do with that.

SCENE: “Apology Stew” – Wren’s POV

She didn’t feel bad about the camera.

Not really.

Okay. Maybe a little.

He hadn’t yelled. He hadn’t deleted. He hadn’t even commented on the part where she used his sunglasses for mirror selfies.

Which meant: he was either stewing silently... or planning her death in five languages.

So she did the only logical thing.

She made dinner.

Sort of.

The safehouse kitchen was not... welcoming.

Everything was gray. Cold. The stove clicked like it hadn’t been used in years.
The spice rack consisted of:

salt

black pepper

three identical jars labeled “Red Powder (Mild?)”

Still. She had vision.

She’d found dried lentils, some sad potatoes, a suspiciously aggressive garlic bulb, and something in a vacuum seal labeled “Ration Mix B (Do Not Open Near Flame).”

Perfect.

She put on one of his button-up shirts again—because it made her feel powerful—and tied a dish towel around her waist like an apron.

An hour later?

The kitchen looked like it lost a knife fight to a spice blender.

Cutlery everywhere. Garlic skins stuck to the ceiling.
One pan actually on fire for a minute.

She stirred what looked like volcanic sludge, tasted it—not bad?—then sprinkled some mystery flakes over the top.

Boom.
Dinner.

And somehow... it smelled amazing.

SCENE: “You Tried to Poison Me with Love” – Kellan’s POV

He came back expecting silence.

Instead, he smelled cumin.
And... something comforting.

Instant suspicion.

He stepped into the kitchen. Froze.

The countertops were wrecked.
There were potato peels on his gun bag.
And she was stirring something that looked like illegal soup.

She turned, beaming.

“I made you dinner.”

Pause.

“You tried to blow up my coffee once. Why would I eat anything you cooked?”

“Because it smells good?”

“It smells like betrayal. And paprika.”

She shoved a bowl at him.

“I didn’t follow a recipe. I used intuition and mild resentment.”

He stared into the bowl.

It was... brown.

And lumpy.

And maybe alive.

She raised an eyebrow.

“Oh come on. What’s the worst that could happen? I accidentally kill you and get your knife collection?”

He sat.

Picked up the spoon.

Paused.

“If I die—”

“You won’t.”

He took a bite.

Chewed.

Stopped.

Chewed slower.

Looked at her.

“This is... actually incredible.”

She grinned. Sat across from him, smug.

“I call it: whatever was in the back of the drawer stew.”

He took another bite. Then a third.

Then set the spoon down.

“I still hate you.”

“Of course you do.”

They didn’t speak for a few minutes.

But he kept eating.

And she didn’t stop watching him with that hopeful I-swear-this-isn’t-poison look.

And something warm crept in between them.

Not just food.

Not just survival.

Something dangerously close to comfort.
