### Wren and Kellan prequel vignette from their “lost domestic files.”
Wren, wide awake at 12:23 AM, stuck between a kid named Captain Smashinator and a half-shed-fluff-ball cat named Spotty, muttering,
“Why do I have a tiny screwdriver in my bed?”
Meanwhile, Kellan, from across the room, deadpan:
“It’s his weapon of choice. I trained him.”
Spotty stares into the corner, mid-cry.
Kellan doesn’t blink. “I taught the cat that, too.”
Wren: “...You’re not helping.”
Kellan: “You said you wanted support.”
Wren: “Emotional support. Not tactical reinforcements from a cat with unresolved trauma.”
Kellan, getting up to make tuna: “Same thing.”

### Worst First Date Ever
“This is the worst first date I’ve ever been on.”  
“Is that what this is?”  
“You didn’t deny it.”  
“You should’ve run.”  
“You should’ve killed me.”  
Silence.  
“So why didn’t you?”  
“Because… you remind me I used to feel.”

## ❤️ Emotional / Turning Points

## 🔥 Virginia Whisper
- Wren’s memory of working in rural Virginia, where a man with drill equipment casually joked, “No one would hear her scream.”

- Line it inspires: *"Nothing. Because I locked the doors."*

## 📚 Pew Pew and Other Warning Signs  
**Scene Module: Wren – Red Couch Moment**  
*Category: Romance / Spy Drama / Visual Aesthetic Canon*

#### 📝 Summary:
This scene captures Wren in a single, emotionally charged moment: lounging on a red couch in an oversized white shirt (his) and olive-green army fatigues (hers), with moody lighting and a finger gun raised casually in mock threat. It balances intimacy, tension, absurdity, and the haunting quiet before a storm. The moment is iconic, untouchable—and deliberately left unresolved.

#### 🧠 Creative Notes:
**Key Visual Elements:**
- Red couch (safehouse setting)
- White shirt = his Shabbat shirt, soft and slightly stolen
- Olive-green fatigues = Israeli army surplus, worn like second skin
- Light: golden, dramatic, slightly dusty
- Finger gun: raised, deadpan, no smile

**Dialogue:**
> **Wren:** “Pew pew.”  
> **Kellan:** “You’re insane.”  
> **Wren:** “Not legally. Technically. I checked.”

#### 🔥 Mood:
- Suspenseful stillness
- Unspoken desire
- Weaponized sarcasm
- Glimpses of emotional risk through gesture and clothing

#### 🎨 Visual Variations Created:
- Line drawing (minimalist)
- Shadow drawing (high contrast threshold)
- Digital painting: “Romance Novel Cover” (glowing eyes)
- Digital painting: “Chiaroscuro Descent” (moody and cinematic)

#### 📖 Expanded Fiction Elements:

**Back Cover Blurb:**
Wren was just a photojournalist with too much caffeine and not enough backup.  
Kellan was a ghost with a past.  
She saw something she wasn’t meant to.  
He was sent to erase it.  
Instead, she stole his shirt, took his couch, and became his most dangerous mission.

**Classified File Excerpt (WRN-947-HH):**
> Status: Civilian Threat  
> Affiliation: Subject K-13 (probable)  
> Profile: High-functioning chaos vector. Susceptible to emotionally unavailable men with trauma stares.  
> Last seen: wearing Subject’s shirt. Weapon: finger gun. Risk: catastrophic.

#### 💡 Notes from the Author:
> “Sleep is where the chaos grows. Salvador Dali connected with aliens through his moustache—I just use a couch, a camera, and a fake pew pew.”  
> – Chaos Goblin (Agent Alias: You Know Who You Are)

#### 🚨 DO NOT RESOLVE
> The magic is in its preservation. No kiss. No fight.  
> Just the shirt. The stare. The raised fingers.  
> And everything unsaid.

## 🔁 Kellan **Visual Memory**
- Younger Kellan in a training facility or underground classroom.
- A female mentor leans over his shoulder as he solves a code puzzle.
- Her hand touches his back. Her voice: “You always were the quickest, K.”
**Usage:**  
Use sparingly—1–2 second flash in early chapters. No explanation. Creates intrigue.

## 🧪 Experimental / Out-of-Order Ideas

### 📝 Fake Journal Entry
- Kellan has to pose as Wren online. Writes a fake blog post mimicking her tone.
- Accidentally reveals how well he knows her.

### 🌀 Alternate Escape
- What if Wren had run the first time instead of freezing?
- Explore how the story would’ve changed. Flashback? Dream?

## Safehouse 4: Ari's Loft – “The Fashion Refuge”

**Location:** Urban penthouse in a trendy, gentrified district  
**Duration:** 1–2 nights  
**Primary Function:** Temporary sanctuary, disguise transformation, intel exchange

### Description:
Ari’s loft is an explosion of color and personality wrapped in sleek, curated elegance. Bright white walls serve as gallery backdrops to bold, modern art and rainbow-themed accent pieces. A burnt-orange velvet couch anchors the living room, flanked by jewel-toned pillows and a rich Persian rug. Custom bookshelves glow with a perfect gradient of color-coded spines. The air smells like citrus and bergamot.

Closets are open displays of possibility—racks of silk, leather, sequins, and practicality, too. Plants in ceramic pots line the window, sharing space with a rainbow-striped throw blanket and fresh-cut flowers in a cobalt vase.

### Key Events:
- Wren gets a real meal, hot shower, and stylish disguise (whether she wants it or not).
- Ari sasses Kellan unapologetically and clocks his emotional constipation within seconds.
- They receive critical intel about Syndicate movement—and maybe a warning from Ari about someone following Wren.
- Wren feels temporarily human again, laughing for the first time in ages.
- Kellan quietly checks the window locks and notes a drawer that’s unusually well-secured.

### Wren’s Rating: ★★★★★  
> “Finally, a place that doesn’t smell like blood and regret. Would live here forever if we weren’t fugitives.”

### QUOTES:
- “You kidnapped her? Darling. If you wanted her attention, there are easier ways.”
---

**Notes:**
- Ari may be more connected than he lets on. He knew things he shouldn’t.  
- Possible callback location if Wren is ever separated from Kellan.  
- Could serve as neutral ground in a future Syndicate standoff.

Okay, so yeah. He’s weird.
Like... suspiciously quiet.
And he has that “dead-inside-but-maybe-I-write-poetry-at-night” look.
But he also carried her broken tripod off the festival field like it weighed nothing. And when she tripped on that kid’s foam sword in the mud, he caught her with one arm like he was trained by wolves or something.
So... yeah. Maybe he’s a little intense. Maybe he stares a bit too long. Maybe when he said “If I wanted you dead, you’d be cold already,” he was just...
acting. Theater trauma therapy. That’s a thing, right?
“He’s probably been through something.”
“Some kind of deep betrayal. Or secret spy upbringing.”
“Maybe his mom left. Or his dad was a warlord. Or he got kicked out of fencing school.”
And the way he handled that gun? Okay. Yeah. That was definitely a prop. Or a stage weapon. They do that in those super immersive LARPs. He probably watched John Wick and then spent months learning how to take apart a Glock for realism.
Also: he’s hot.
Like, unfairly hot.
Hot in a leaning-against-a-dumpster-looking-like-a-Bourne-spin-off kind of way.
Hot in a he-said-my-name-once-and-now-I-want-it-as-a-ringtone kind of way.
And when he said “You should be careful,” it definitely wasn’t a threat. It was concern. Stoic, emotionally unavailable concern.
That’s the good stuff.
So no—she’s not scared of him. Not really. She’s intrigued. Maybe a little concerned about his mental state. But mostly...
“Honestly, he could be an assassin. But like, the reformed kind.”
She should probably just keep an eye on him.
You know. For his sake.




Scene: She Confides… To Him
They cross paths again—this time, at a local coffee shop. She’s convinced he’s just a quiet, awkward regular. Maybe a reenactor. He ends up seated next to her (because of course). She's rattled from a weird noise outside her place last night and finally blurts:
“Okay, this is going to sound insane, but I think I’m being watched.”
(He raises an eyebrow.)
“And I’m pretty sure it’s that guy from the festival. Lord... Zorro or something?”
(Long pause)
“He had a sword and this... vibe. It was hot. But like, dangerous hot. Not good hot.”
Kellan just nods slowly, fighting every instinct not to strangle her right there.
“Dangerous hot. Got it.”
(sips his coffee)
“You should be careful.”


“If we die here, I just want to say—you’re hot. And very chill for a man with obvious trauma.”
He leans close. Low voice. No smile.
“If I wanted you dead, you’d be cold already.”
She shivers.
Then awkwardly laughs.
“Okay, wow. That’s a... pretty intense compliment.”
