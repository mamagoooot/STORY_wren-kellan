### 🧸 Mr. Pancake Retrieval
- Wren insists on going back to her apartment for her laptop, a few personal items, and Mr. Pancake (a sentimental stuffed animal).

## ❤️ Emotional / Turning Points

### 🧿 Scar Reveal
- Wren notices Kellan’s scar during a close moment. It’s healed, old, not cosmetic.
- She asks — he doesn’t answer. But something shifts.

### 🪑 Silent Comfort
- Wren has an emotional collapse (teeth grit, not tears). Kellan is there.
- He doesn’t offer comfort. Just stays in the room. His silence is the gesture.
